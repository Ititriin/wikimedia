#### Making angular app locally

- Get the latest version of Node.js (check with: node -v)

- Install node modules: 
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Install Angular CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

- Be sure you installed angular - can also try sudo for extra power (check with: ng --version)

- Generate new application
  ```bash
  ng new app
  ```

- During the installation choose your preferred options, for example:
  - Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
  - which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
- Start the generated application by:

```bash
cd app
```

```bash
ng serve
```

- It will provide you with an url if everything's okay (http://localhost:4200/)
- Continue working with local angular :)
